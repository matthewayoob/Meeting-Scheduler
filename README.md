**How to Run and Test the Code**

To test the code, copy and paste it into any Python environment, such as a Jupyter notebook, Python script, or an online IDE like Replit. The test cases are included at the bottom of the script, and running the code will print “All tests passed” if everything is working correctly.

**Explanation of the Algorithm**

The goal of the algorithm is to identify available time slots of a given duration from multiple overlapping schedules. We merge busy intervals from these schedules to avoid conflicts and then search for gaps between the merged intervals as potential free slots.

**Algorithm Design Choices + Steps**

1. Flatten and Sort Intervals
• All busy intervals from multiple schedules are flattened into a single list and sorted by start time.
2. Merge Overlapping Intervals
• Overlapping or adjacent intervals are merged to avoid scheduling conflicts and minimize redundancy.
3. Find Free Intervals
• We identify gaps between merged intervals and calculate the time between them as free slots.
4. Filter Valid Slots by Duration
• From the free intervals, we select those that meet the required duration and return the first 5 slots (if available).
5. Edge Case Handling
• If no valid free slots are found, the function returns None.
• It also gracefully handles empty schedules and negative durations.

**Time Complexity**

• Flattening and Sorting: O(N log N), where N is the total number of intervals.

• Merging Intervals: O(N), as we iterate through the sorted list once.

• Finding Free Intervals: O(M), where M is the number of merged intervals.

• Filtering Valid Slots: O(M), as we filter the free slots by the required duration.

Thus, the overall runtime complexity is O(N log N), dominated by the sorting step. This makes the algorithm efficient even for large inputs.

**“Best Time” Consideration**

The algorithm prioritizes the earliest available slots in the day. It starts from midnight (00:00) and checks for the first available free slots, returning up to 5 valid options. This ensures users are presented with the earliest suitable times. This could be easily changed to certain agreed-on workday time ranges!
